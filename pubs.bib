  abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) allows for two parties to establish a shared secret key which is secure against an all-powerful adversary (a task impossible to achieve using only classical communication). Furthermore, any attack against these systems creates an observable "noise signature." This work develops a new solution representation for QKD protocols allowing a GA to evolve optimal protocols to counter observed attacks against the communication.},
